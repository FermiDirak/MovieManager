# Movie List App


## Level 1 - Front end

- [ ] Display a list of movies from data hardcoded in your index.jsx.
- [ ] Add a search bar so that a user may see if a movie is in the list. 
- [ ] After a user submits the search, display all matches (or partial matches) to that title.
- [ ] Bonus: Handle the case of no movie by that name found gracefully.
- [ ] Add an input field for users to add movies.
- [ ] Add a button to each list item that allows the user to toggle a 'watched' property.
- [ ] Add two buttons to allow the users to toggle between a list of 'watched' movies and movies 'to watch'.
- [ ] Add a panel of movie information that appears when the title is clicked (consider starting with hardcoded information)

You can use the following data: 

```javascript
var movies = [
  {title: 'Mean Girls'},
  {title: 'Hackers'},
  {title: 'The Grey'},
  {title: 'Sunshine'},
  {title: 'Ex Machina'},
];
```
